# Introduction

This repository shows you how to create a plugin for the Data Prepper framework. It contains a very simple plugin that performs FizzBuzz on lines of text. The project is built using Gradle and there are pointers on how to setup a repository and build your own plugin using Gradle.

There are three categories of plugins for Data Prepper: **core**, **maintained**, and **community**. Core plugins are plugins that are contained in the main Data Prepper repository and are required for Data Prepper to run. Maintained plugins are plugins that are maintained by the Data Prepper team. Finally, community plugins are plugins created and owned by the community. Maintained and community plugins are released to Maven Central.

This sample plugin is an example of a **maintained** or **community** plugin and the instructions will describe how to build a plugin of this style. Building a core plugin is not much different and the differences will be noted as you go through the tutorial.

# Prerequisites

In order to build this project you will need to have a few tools and directories set up on your development system.

1. Gradle
1. A Java Development Kit (JDK)
1. Git command line tools  
1. GitHub or another source code control (optional)

You can follow the Gradle getting started guide [here](https://gradle.org/install/) if you do not already have Gradle installed and configured. You can use any number of Java Development Kits, but we suggest the newest [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/). The git command-line interface tools can be downloaded from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Finally, if you'd like to save your plugin in source control, you can create an account on [GitHub](https://www.github.com).

Once you've completed the prerequisites we are ready to get started.
