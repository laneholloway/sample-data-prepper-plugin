# Introduction

This repository shows you how to create a plugin for the Data Prepper framework. It contains a very simple plugin that performs FizzBuzz on lines of text. The project is built using Gradle and there are pointers on how to setup a repository and build your own plugin using Gradle.

# Prerequisites

In order to build this project you will need to have a few tools and directories set up on your development system.

1. Gradle
1. A Java Development Kit (JDK)
1. Git command line tools  
1. GitHub or another source code control (optional)

You can follow the Gradle getting started guide [here](https://gradle.org/install/) if you do not already have Gradle installed and configured. You can use any number of Java Development Kits, but we suggest the newest [Amazon Corretto](https://aws.amazon.com/corretto/). The git command-line interface tools can be downloaded from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads). Finally, if you'd like to save your plugin in source control, you can create an account on [GitHub](https://www.github.com).

Once you've completed the prerequisites we are ready to get started.
